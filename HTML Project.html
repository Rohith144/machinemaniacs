<h2 style="color:blue;">What is DC Machine?</h2>
<p>A DC machine is an electromechanical energy alteration device. The working principle of a DC machine is when electric current flows through a coil within 
a magnetic field, and then the magnetic force generates a torque which rotates the dc motor. The DC machines are classified into two types such as DC generator 
as well as DC motor. The main function of the DC generator is to convert mechanical power to DC electrical power, whereas a DC motor converts DC power to
mechanical power. DC motor is applicable where the good speed regulation & ample range of speeds are necessary like in electric-transaction systems.</p>
<h2 style="color:blue;">Types of DC Machine:</h2>

<h4 style="color:green;">Separately Excited DC Machine:</h4>
<p>In Separately Excited DC Machine, a separate DC source is utilized for activating the field coils.</p>
<h4 style="color:green;">Shunt Wound DC Machine:</h4>
<p>In Shunt wound DC Machines, the field coils are allied in parallel through the armature. As the shunt field gets the complete o/p voltage of a generator 
otherwise a motor supply voltage, it is normally made of a huge number of twists of fine wire with a small field current carrying.</p>
<h4 style="color:green;">Series Wound DC Machine:</h4>
<p>In series wound D.C. Machines, the field coils are allied in series through the armature. As series field winding gets the armature current, 
as well as the armature current is huge, due to this the series field winding includes few twists of wire of big cross-sectional region.</p>
<h4 style="color:green;">Compound Wound DC Machine:</h4>
<p>A compound machine includes both the series as well as shunt fields. The two windings are carried-out with every machine pole. 
The series winding of the machine includes few twists of a huge cross-sectional region, as well as the shunt windings, include several fine wire twists.</p>
